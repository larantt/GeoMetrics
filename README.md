## GeoMetrics

<p>Geometrics is a python package used to simplify the process of statistical analysis of data in the
Geosciences. It is beginner-friendly, with functions designed to perform a number of "baked-in" analysis
routines including checking normality, curve fitting, and data-model comparison metrics assessments
with only a few calls. This includes the integration of tedious plotting code, allowing the user
to generate publication-focused, accessible and clean figures and tables without spending hours on basic
formatting with matplotlib.</p>

<p>GeoMetrics is designed following the principles of Dr Micheal Liemohn's textbook
[Data Analysis for the Geosciences: Uncertainty, Comparison and Visualisation](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Data+Analysis+for+the+Geosciences%3A+Essentials+of+Uncertainty%2C+Comparison%2C+and+Visualization-p-9781119747895), and will work in tandem with many of the exercises included.</p>
